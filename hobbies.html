        <h2>Motorsport</h2>
        <p>
            I am a avid motorsport fan, mainly due to the fact that the engineering that goes into designing Racecars, Rally cars, GT3 cars etc.,. facinates me along with the fact the drivers who operate these vehicles are able to discern the minute differences that would help them either gain the advantage in a race with their opponents or the ability to identify methods to help them shave off the tenth of a second that would mean either victory or defeat in a competition

        <h2>Coding</h2>
        <p>
            One of my most useful yet entertaining hobbies is coding the activity of creating code to either solve different problems or to perform a few creative tricks with the code.
